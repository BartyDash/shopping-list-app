## Project Description

This project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to make daily shopping easier for users.</br>
The main goal of the application is to allow users to easily manage their shopping list from any device, thanks to full user authentication. This way, users can be sure that their shopping list is always available and synchronized between different platforms.</br>
The application offers a simple user interface that allows you to quickly add and delete items on your shopping list.</br>
In addition, to make it easier and faster to create a list there is a typeahead function that suggests items already entered once before.

## Features

- user registration and login
- downloading a shopping list from an online database
- adding and removing items from the list
- suggesting items that have already been entered once before

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS - mostly [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- JavaScript
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - web bundler
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Database and User Authentication

### What I learned

I learned a lot of new things but the project was mainly created to familiarize myself with Firebase. I learned how to authorize users and how to properly save data in the database and how to secure it. By the way, I learned an interesting [library](https://github.com/digitalfortress-tech/typeahead-standalone) to typeahead which I will be happy to use also in future projects.
